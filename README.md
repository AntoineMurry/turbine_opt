# turbine_opt

Balancing turbines by optimizing blade distribution

Python package, with optimization object -Simulated Annealing model-.

This package helps distribute blades on a turbine in order to minimize its total
unbalance. Distributing blades with different masses randomly would lead
to a global unbalance which can break the turbine when it rotates at high
 speed.

Another constraint is that the different weights should form up 4 lobes of
mass, in order to maximize turbine lifespan.

A script has been created for demo. Install the package by typing
 "$ make install" at package root, then simply type "$ turbine-opt-example".

Below is the tree of the package. 

Optimization code is in optimization.py, other code specific to the
turbine problem is in lib.py.

Unit tests are in the tests/ folder.

In order for the user to be able to play with the package, a sample of data
(input-data.csv) has be placed in turbine-opt/data/. This dataset
corresponds to a set of blades which needs to be distributed in an optimal
manner on the turbine, in order to minimize global unbalance.

To DO: wrap model into web app (flask or django) to create user-friendly interface.
